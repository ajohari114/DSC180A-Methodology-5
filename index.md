# Questions
- **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
  - The most interesting thing for me was working with image data to extract colormetrics for later feature engineering. This was already implemented by the research group but it was very interesting for me to enhance the image processing to make it faster and extract more information from the image metadata.
- **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
  - I would like to investigate different machine leaning models that can be implemented. This will involve different feature engineering techniques as well as different models as a whole.
- **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
  - I would like to understand how to do graph-machine learning as that will be more effective to run across the entire graph as opposed to make a tabular dataframe to do traditional machine learning using sci-kit learn.
- **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
  - I would like to learn techniques such as updating a graph database on a regular basis but perhaps also learn how to use computer vision to further enhance the image processing that the research group already does.
